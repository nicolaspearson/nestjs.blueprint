# Dellingr

A simple [NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) starter repository built using TypeScript.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
yarn install
```

### Building, Running, and Testing the Application

```bash
# Build the application
yarn build

# Lint the application
yarn lint

# Start the application in dev mode
yarn start:dev

# Execute the unit tests for the application
yarn test:unit

# Execute the integration tests for the application
yarn test:integration
```

The project can also be built and started using docker:

> Note: Using docker will start the application in production mode, which excludes database
> fixtures.

```bash
# Build the application using docker
yarn docker:build

# Build and start the application using docker
yarn docker:start

# Attach to the docker logs for the application
yarn docker:logs
```

### Swagger

Swagger documentation is served on [localhost](http://localhost:3000/docs/dellingr/#/). Requests
can be executed directly from the Swagger user interface. The example documentation contains valid
fixtures that are automatically populated on application start-up.

### Database

This package uses TypeORM and PostgreSQL.

#### Migrations

To generate the missing migrations TypeORM applies existing migrations, and uses the diff between
the database schema and the TypeORM entities to create a migration file.

```sh
# Replace <migration-name> with a descriptive name for the generated migration
yarn db:migration:generate:missing <migration-name>
```

#### Structure

The database structure can be seen below (documented using `mermaid.js`):

```mermaid
erDiagram
    USER {
        uuid uuid
        string email
        string password
        date created_at
        date updated_at
    }
```
